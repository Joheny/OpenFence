#OpenFence
OpenFence is a digital livestock fencing system, which uses GPS and stereo audio alerts to contain animals within a specified boundary. 
The location of the fences can be updated using the web interface, and transferred to collar devices wirelessly using LoRa via the in field base station. 
The movements of the animals are logged and transferred to the web, to allow analysis of movements and land utilisation.
#The Purpose
OpenFence is designed to make it easier to implement productive and environmentally friendly grazing practises, such as cell grazing. 
This style of grazing has been shown to increase biodiversity, ground cover, soil carbon and water retention, however it is not commonly implemented due to the additional expenses of fencing and labour.
